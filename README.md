# EPI Judge
The solutions in this repository (within the "epi_judge_cpp" directory) are just my own solutions. Everything else is the work of [Adnan Aziz](https://github.com/adnanaziz) and [Viacheslav Kroilov](https://github.com/metopa), who graciously created the [original repository](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge.git) from which this fork derives. They have provided a test harness, test cases, and solutions for the readers of [__Elements Of Programming Interviews__](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com) (by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash).
